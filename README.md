# Flowtastic

![Hero](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36173828/221955288-83eb727c-c0f9-4043-8dae-4e84d6b0f0ec.png)

# Overview
Flowtastic is a mobile-first, easy-to-navigate and easy-to-install progressive web app. Users can find, compare, and choose the right moment. It provides a familiar interface with social login for mainstream users. The user can discover moments within the app by exploring all moments or filtering, and then connecting his/her wallet to see the reviews left for the moments in her collection. There are not only reviews but also comparisons to help you make better decisions. The reviews use a hybrid model that can be stored on traditional databases as well as immutable and stored on the blockchain. We go to My Reviews to see all our published reviews.

# Problem
Hard to compare moments
Individual collectors want to compare stats to ensure they are making the best decision.

No connections
Collecting is an emotional thing. 
What is the story behind that moment? How did other collectors live it or think about it?

portfolio rating
It is hard to know what other collectors think about our moments.

# Solution
Community Review - 
Collectors offer the most useful guide. Let the community tell the story.

Quick Compare - 
Simplify collectors' research by displaying Moments side-by-side.

Portfolio rating - 
Simply connect the wallet to show details and reviews of all the moments.
