  Find, compare and choose the right Moment with user reviews.

# Flowtastic

# Overview
Flowtastic is a mobile-first, easy-to-navigate and easy-to-install progressive web app. Users can find, compare, and choose the right moment. It provides a familiar interface with social login for mainstream users. The user can discover moments within the app by exploring all moments or filtering, and then connecting his/her wallet to see the reviews left for the moments in her collection. There are not only reviews but also comparisons to help you make better decisions. The reviews use a hybrid model that can be stored on traditional databases as well as immutable and stored on the blockchain. We go to My Reviews to see all our published reviews.
